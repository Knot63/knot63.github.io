            <h3>Product Strategist</h3>
            <p>You've launched products and made them grow; you've seen companies grow from working from the founder's living room to hundreds of people; you connect the lines between the business model, the product, and the marketing campaign.</p>
            <p>You're a fierce analyst and have a proven track record of managing products and product growth. You can't see into the future, but if you claimed you could others would probably believe you. You're known for asking really hard questions. You're our first product strategist.</p>

            <a href="mailto:jobs@knot63.com?subject=I'm your next Graphic Designer" class="apply upper">Apply now</a>
            <h3>Graphic Designer</h3>
            <p>A logo, an entire brand, a user interface or a landing page &mdash; you've done it all, and your work always raises an eyebrow. Creating something stunningly beautiful and simple makes you as happy as the feeling of fully grasping a problem with all its wicked twists and conundrums.</p>
            <p>Your portfolio is as diverse as it is because every problem requires a different solution, and every project poses a different set of problems. Yet your work always conveys something deeply human: a sense of lightness, elegance, and perceptiveness. You're our next designer.</p>

            <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
            <p>Where others see a 8 GB SQL dump, you see a thousand stories waiting to be uncovered. You're characterized by an overdose of curiosity with a healthy serving of skepticism. You can run an analytics campaign to optimize a sales funnel or build a web-scarping, NL processing recommendation.</p>
            <p>You know the tools of the trade and know which one fits the problem &mdash; Hadoop and Excel can co-exist peacefully. You're used to being the smartest kid in the room. You don't care if anybody else know that. Your work speaks for itself. You're our next data scientist.</p>
